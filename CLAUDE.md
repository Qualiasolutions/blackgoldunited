# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
BlackGoldUnited is a comprehensive ERP system built for business management with 14 interconnected modules. The system handles sales, clients, inventory, purchases, finance, accounting, HR, payroll, attendance, QHSE, templates, reports, and organizational structure with strict role-based access control.

## Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.3 with TypeScript and React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4.14 with shadcn/ui component system
- **Database**: PostgreSQL deployed on Supabase with direct SQL queries
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with SSR support (@supabase/ssr)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form v7.63.0 with Zod validation
- **Data Tables**: TanStack Table v8.21.3 for complex data grids
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic deployments

## Essential Development Commands

### Database Management
```bash
# Create database backup
npm run db:backup

# Supabase-specific database operations:
# - Schema changes: Use Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor or migration files
# - Direct queries: Use Supabase MCP tools or SQL Editor
# - Database admin: Access Supabase Dashboard at https://supabase.com/dashboard
# - Local development: Use createClient() from @/lib/supabase/client or server
```

### Authentication Management
```bash
# Test login credentials (production):
# Email: admin@blackgoldunited.com
# Password: admin123
# Role: MANAGEMENT (full access)

# Additional test users:
# finance@blackgoldunited.com / admin123 (FINANCE_TEAM)
# procurement@blackgoldunited.com / admin123 (PROCUREMENT_BD)

# Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth with:
# - Email/password authentication
# - Role-based access control via user metadata
# - Session management with SSR support
# - Automatic session refresh in middleware
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development server with Turbopack
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

### Component Architecture
```bash
# Main layout system:
# - app/layout.tsx - Root layout with providers
# - components/layout/main-layout.tsx - Sidebar + header layout
# - components/layout/sidebar.tsx - 14-module navigation
# - components/layout/header.tsx - Top navigation with user menu

# Authentication components:
# - components/auth/protected-route.tsx - Route-level protection
# - components/auth/role-guard.tsx - Component-level role checks
# - components/providers/AuthProvider.tsx - Auth context provider

# Module-specific components:
# - components/modules/sales/ - Sales module components
# - components/modules/clients/ - Client management components
# - components/modules/inventory/ - Inventory components
# - components/modules/purchase/ - Purchase components

# shadcn/ui components:
# - components/ui/ - Reusable UI primitives (button, input, table, etc.)
# - components/data-table/ - Advanced data table with search/filtering
```

### Supabase Integration
```bash
# Client-side authentication (hooks):
# useAuth() - Custom hook for authentication state management
# - login(credentials) - Sign in with email/password
# - logout() - Sign out user
# - signup(data) - Create new user account
# - user - Current user session data with role and permissions

# Server-side authentication:
# import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
# const supabase = await createClient()
# const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

# Environment variables (already configured on Vercel):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL - Supabase project URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY - Supabase anonymous key
```

### Testing Setup
```bash
# Current testing status:
# - No tests configured yet (package.json shows placeholder scripts)
# - Test framework: Not yet implemented
# - Coverage: Not yet implemented

# To add testing:
# npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
# npm install --save-dev @types/jest jest-environment-jsdom
```

### Role-Based Access Control Matrix
The system implements strict access control based on 5 user roles:

| Module | MANAGEMENT | FINANCE_TEAM | PROCUREMENT_BD | ADMIN_HR | IMS_QHSE |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| Administration | Full (F) | Read (R) | None (N) | Full (F) | None (N) |
| Finance | Full (F) | Full (F) | Read (R) | None (N) | None (N) |
| Procurement | Full (F) | Read (R) | Full (F) | None (N) | None (N) |
| Projects & Operations | Full (F) | Read (R) | Full (F) | None (N) | Read (R) |
| IMS/Compliance | Full (F) | None (N) | None (N) | None (N) | Full (F) |
| Correspondence | Full (F) | None (N) | Read (R) | Read (R) | Read (R) |

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Core Architecture**: Next.js 15.5.3 + TypeScript + React 19 setup

## Key File Locations and Patterns

### Configuration Files
- **middleware.ts**: Route protection with Supabase Auth integration
- **app/layout.tsx**: Root layout with providers and global styles
- **lib/supabase/client.ts**: Browser Supabase client configuration
- **lib/supabase/server.ts**: Server-side Supabase client (SSR)
- **lib/hooks/useAuth.ts**: Authentication state management hook
- **lib/config/navigation.ts**: Navigation structure and role permissions
- **lib/types/**: TypeScript type definitions (auth.ts, bgu.ts)

### Important Conventions
- **Database**: Use Supabase client, NOT Prisma (schema exists but not actively used)
- **Authentication**: Always use useAuth() hook for client-side auth
- **Route Protection**: middleware.ts handles all route-level protection
- **Components**: Follow shadcn/ui patterns, use className with cn() utility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with consistent design tokens
- **Navigation**: Role-based module access defined in lib/config/navigation.ts

### Module Structure Pattern
```
app/[module]/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx              # Main module page
â”œâ”€â”€ [sub-module]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx         # Sub-module page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ create/page.tsx  # Create form page

components/modules/[module]/
â”œâ”€â”€ [module]-list.tsx    # List view component
â”œâ”€â”€ [module]-form.tsx    # Create/edit form
â””â”€â”€ [module]-card.tsx    # Card display component
```

- Approval workflow (email-based or in-system)
- Retention policies (invoices: 10 years, HR: 5 years after leaving)
- Folder-based organization with access rights
- Remote accessibility requirement

### Data Security Requirements
- Regular backups with password protection
- Audit trails for all financial transactions
- Role-based data access enforcement
- Secure document storage and retrieval
- Compliance with financial regulations

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards
- **ESLint**: Follow established linting rules (npm run lint)
- **TypeScript**: Maintain strict type checking (npm run type-check)
- **Components**: Use shadcn/ui patterns and conventions
- **Styling**: Consistent Tailwind CSS usage with design tokens
- **Authentication**: Always validate user permissions before data access

### Security Guidelines
- **Route Protection**: All protected routes handled by middleware.ts
- **Authentication**: Use Supabase Auth for all authentication flows
- **Role Validation**: Check user roles before displaying sensitive UI elements
- **Input Validation**: Use Zod schemas for form and API validation
- **Environment Variables**: Keep secrets secure and properly configured

### Performance Considerations
- **Client Components**: Use 'use client' directive only when necessary
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component for optimized loading
- **Database Queries**: Optimize Supabase queries with proper indexing
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize bundle size with Next.js analyzer

Remember to run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` before committing changes.
