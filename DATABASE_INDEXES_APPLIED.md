## 🔍 Verification

All indexes verified with query:
```sql
SELECT tablename, indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Result**: 109 total indexes (existing + newly created)

---

## ⚡ Index Types Used

### 1. Standard B-Tree Indexes
Most common, used for equality and range queries.
**Example**: `idx_clients_email`

### 2. Partial Indexes
Only index rows matching a condition, very efficient.
**Example**: `idx_clients_is_active WHERE is_active = true`

### 3. Composite Indexes
Index multiple columns together for complex queries.
**Example**: `idx_invoices_client_status ON (client_id, status)`

### 4. Descending Indexes
Optimized for DESC sorting (recent-first).
**Example**: `idx_invoices_created_at DESC`

## 📝 Notes

### What Was NOT Indexed
Some indexes from the original plan were skipped because the columns don't exist in the actual schema:
- `employees.employee_code` (actual: `employee_number`)
- `employees.full_name` (actual: separate `first_name`, `last_name`)
- `products.stock_quantity` (stock tracked in separate `stocks` table)
- `purchase_orders.expected_delivery_date` (column doesn't exist)
- Tables `attendance`, `leave_requests`, `payroll_records` (actual names: `attendance_logs`, `leave_applications`, `pay_slips`)

These tables already had their own indexes created previously.

### Index Maintenance
Indexes are automatically maintained by PostgreSQL. No manual maintenance required.

**Optional Maintenance** (can run monthly):
```sql
-- Update table statistics for query planner
ANALYZE clients;
ANALYZE invoices;
ANALYZE employees;
ANALYZE products;
ANALYZE suppliers;
ANALYZE purchase_orders;
```
