- [ ] **Task 6.10**: Create purchase reporting

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS TO FOLLOW**

I've established **proven patterns** that you MUST follow for consistency:

### **1. API Structure Pattern**
```typescript
// /app/api/purchases/suppliers/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
import { authenticateAndAuthorize } from '@/lib/auth/api-auth'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Authenticate and authorize
  const authResult = await authenticateAndAuthorize(request, 'purchases', 'GET')
  if (!authResult.success) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: authResult.error }, { status: authResult.status })
  }

  // 2. Extract query parameters with pagination
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const query = searchParams.get('query') || ''
  const page = parseInt(searchParams.get('page') || '1')
  const limit = parseInt(searchParams.get('limit') || '10')

  // 3. Build Supabase query with relations
  const supabase = await createClient()
  let queryBuilder = supabase
    .from('suppliers')
    .select(`*, _count:purchase_orders(count)`)

  // 4. Apply filters and pagination
  if (query) {
    queryBuilder = queryBuilder.or(`name.ilike.%${query}%,email.ilike.%${query}%`)
  }

  // 5. Return standardized response
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    data: suppliers || [],
    pagination: { page, limit, total: totalCount, pages: totalPages }
  })
}
```

### **2. Frontend Page Pattern**
```typescript
// /app/purchases/suppliers/page.tsx
'use client'

import { useAuth, usePermissions } from '@/lib/hooks/useAuth'
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card'
// ... other imports

export default function SuppliersPage() {
  const { user } = useAuth()
  const { hasModuleAccess, hasFullAccess } = usePermissions()

  // State management
  const [suppliers, setSuppliers] = useState([])
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('')
  const [pagination, setPagination] = useState({ page: 1, limit: 10, total: 0, pages: 0 })

  // Permission check
  const canManage = hasFullAccess('purchases')
  const canRead = hasModuleAccess('purchases')

  if (!canRead) {
    return <AccessDeniedComponent />
  }

  // Fetch data with useCallback
  const fetchSuppliers = useCallback(async (params = {}) => {
    // Implementation following inventory patterns
  }, [])

  // Rest of component following established patterns...
}
```

### **3. Form Pattern**
```typescript
// /app/purchases/suppliers/create/page.tsx
// Follow the product creation form pattern exactly
// - Form validation with comprehensive error handling
// - Real-time validation feedback
// - Success/error states with user feedback
// - Proper navigation after successful creation
```

## üîÑ **INTEGRATION POINTS**

### **Database Tables to Use:**
- `suppliers` - Supplier information
- `purchase_orders` - Purchase order records
- `purchase_order_items` - PO line items
- `purchase_invoices` - Purchase invoices
- Connect with existing `products` and `product_stock` tables for inventory updates

### **Role-based Access Control:**
- **MANAGEMENT**: Full access to all purchase operations
- **FINANCE_TEAM**: Read access to suppliers, full access to invoices/payments
- **PROCUREMENT_BD**: Full access to all purchase management
- **ADMIN_HR**: Limited read access to purchase reports
- **IMS_QHSE**: No purchase access (403 Forbidden)

## üèÜ **HANDOFF COMPLETE - GO TIME!**

The inventory management system is **100% functional** and ready for production. All patterns are established, all infrastructure is in place.

**Your job**: Follow the exact same patterns I've established and implement the purchase management system for Week 6. The foundation is solid - now build on it!

**Remember**: Quality over speed. Test thoroughly with all user roles, and update the progress tracker as you complete each task.

**Good luck! üöÄ**
