## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Database Integration**
- Leverages existing database schema with tables:
  - `employees` - Core employee data
  - `departments` - Department hierarchy
  - `designations` - Job titles and positions
  - `employment_types` - Employment classifications
  - `employee_levels` - Hierarchical levels
  - `shifts` - Work shift definitions
  - `employee_shifts` - Shift assignments
  - `attendance_logs` - Attendance records
  - `activity_logs` - Audit trail for all HR operations

### **API Design Patterns**
- **Authentication**: Uses `authenticateAndAuthorize()` middleware
- **Role-based Access Control**:
  - MANAGEMENT: Full access to all HR operations
  - ADMIN_HR: Full HR operations except deletion
  - Other roles: Limited to own records
- **Response Format**: Standardized `{success: true, data: {...}, pagination?: {...}}` format
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Activity Logging**: All operations logged for audit purposes

### **Key Features**
- **Auto-generated IDs**: Employee numbers (EMP-000001 format)
- **Hierarchical Structures**: Departments with parent-child relationships
- **Real-time Calculations**: Hours worked, overtime, progress percentages
- **Soft Deletions**: Data preservation with audit trails
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search, pagination, and multi-criteria filtering
- **Document Management**: File upload, verification, expiry tracking
- **Workflow Management**: Onboarding tasks with status tracking
