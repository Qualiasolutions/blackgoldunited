# BlackGoldUnited ERP - Database Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Supabase Database Setup

Your BlackGoldUnited ERP system uses **Supabase** as the database platform with PostgreSQL as the underlying database.

## Overview

The database schema supports a complete ERP system with 14 integrated modules, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit capabilities. The system uses Supabase's PostgreSQL database with direct SQL queries.

## Database Architecture

### Core Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 5 user roles with granular permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of changes to critical data
- **Data Retention**: Automated cleanup based on configurable retention policies
- **Multi-tenant Ready**: Foundation for future multi-company support
- **Performance Optimized**: Strategic indexes and query optimization
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates

### 14 Integrated Modules

1. **Sales Module**: Invoices, RFQs, payments, credit notes, recurring invoices
2. **Clients Module**: Customer management, contacts, client settings
3. **Inventory Module**: Products, services, warehouses, stock management, requisitions
4. **Purchase Module**: Suppliers, purchase orders, invoices, payments
5. **Finance Module**: Expenses, income, treasuries, bank accounts
6. **Accounting Module**: Journal entries, chart of accounts, cost centers, assets
7. **Employees Module**: Staff management, roles, organizational structure
8. **Attendance Module**: Logs, permissions, shifts, leave management
9. **Payroll Module**: Contracts, pay runs, salary structures, loans
10. **Reports Module**: Comprehensive reporting across all modules
11. **Templates Module**: Printable templates, terms & conditions, documents
12. **QHSE Module**: Policies, procedures, forms, compliance reports
13. **Settings Module**: Account information, system configurations
14. **Organizational Structure**: Departments, designations, employee levels

## Role-Based Access Control Matrix

Based on the BGU Portal Layout requirements:

| Role | Administration | Finance | Procurement | Projects & Operations | IMS/Compliance | Correspondence |
|------|---------------|---------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Management** | Full (F) | Full (F) | Full (F) | Full (F) | Full (F) | Full (F) |
| **Finance Team** | Read (R) | Full (F) | Read (R) | Read (R) | None (N) | None (N) |
| **Procurement/BD** | None (N) | Read (R) | Full (F) | Full (F) | None (N) | Read (R) |
| **Admin/HR** | Full (F) | None (N) | None (N) | None (N) | None (N) | Read (R) |
| **IMS/QHSE** | None (N) | None (N) | None (N) | Read (R) | Full (F) | Read (R) |

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Supabase account and project
- Node.js 18+ with npm
- Git for version control

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blackgoldunited
   npm install
   ```

2. **Supabase Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment variables
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Edit .env.local file with your Supabase credentials
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

3. **Database Schema Setup**
   - Log into your Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Execute your database schema SQL scripts
   - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Create necessary database functions and triggers

4. **Authentication Setup**
   - Configure Supabase Auth settings in dashboard
   - Set up email templates (optional)
   - Configure auth providers if needed
   - Set up user roles and permissions

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run db:backup` - Create database backup using pg_dump

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Supabase as Database Platform

**Decision**: Use Supabase instead of self-managed PostgreSQL
**Rationale**:
- Built-in authentication and authorization
- Real-time subscriptions out of the box
- Automatic API generation
- Managed database with backups
- Scalable infrastructure
- Row Level Security (RLS) support

### 2. Direct SQL Queries over ORM

**Decision**: Use Supabase client with direct SQL queries
**Rationale**:
- Better performance for complex queries
- Full PostgreSQL feature access
- Easier integration with Supabase features
- More control over query optimization
- Real-time subscription capabilities

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

**Decision**: Database-level permissions with Supabase Auth integration
**Rationale**:
- Security at multiple layers
- Granular control per module and action
- Integration with Supabase Auth system
- Future scalability for additional roles
- Compliance with access control matrix requirements

### 4. Audit Trail Implementation

**Decision**: Comprehensive audit logging using PostgreSQL triggers
**Rationale**:
- Automatic tracking without application-level overhead
- Immutable audit records
- Performance optimization through dedicated audit table
- Compliance with financial record-keeping requirements

## Database Schema Architecture

- Query execution statistics
- User authentication logs
- Real-time connection monitoring

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Use Supabase development/staging project
- Test all database changes before production

const supabase = await createClient()
```

### Authentication Integration
```typescript
// Use the custom useAuth hook
import { useAuth } from '@/lib/hooks/useAuth'
